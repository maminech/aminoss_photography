## ❓ FAQ

### Q: What happens if I don't check "Professional Mode"?
A: Photo/video won't appear on the professional (luxury) website. It stays in your library but isn't displayed there.

### Q: Will photos appear in Simple Mode if I upload them?
A: No! Simple Mode shows ONLY Instagram posts. Admin uploads don't appear there unless you're viewing the admin gallery.

### Q: Can I use the same photo in both modes?
A: Technically yes, but Simple Mode only shows Instagram, so it wouldn't work. The separation is intentional to keep Instagram content and professional content separate.

### Q: How do I know which photos are marked for Professional Mode?
A: Look for the amber badge on photos in the grid view. Or check the edit modal - the professional mode checkbox will be checked.

### Q: Can I bulk remove from Professional Mode?
A: Not yet directly, but you can:
1. Select photos
2. Edit each individually, or
3. Use database tools (advanced)

### Q: What's the difference between "Featured" and "Professional Mode"?
- **Featured**: Photo is highlighted/prioritized in its current mode
- **Professional Mode**: Photo specifically displays on luxury website
