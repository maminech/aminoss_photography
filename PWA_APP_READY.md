## ✨ WHY PWA IS BETTER THAN NATIVE APP

### ✅ Advantages:
1. **Works on ANY device** - Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux
2. **No app store** - No Google Play submission, no waiting
3. **No build failures** - No complex React Native compilation
4. **Instant updates** - Changes deploy immediately
5. **Smaller size** - ~5 MB vs ~25 MB native app
6. **Offline support** - Works without internet (cached)
7. **Same features** - Dashboard, invoices, bookings, everything!
8. **Auto-updates** - Users always have latest version

### ❌ What We Avoided:
- EAS Build failures
- React Native version conflicts
- Gradle build errors
- APK hosting issues
- Monthly rebuilds (Expo links expire)
- Android Studio requirements
- Complex dependencies
