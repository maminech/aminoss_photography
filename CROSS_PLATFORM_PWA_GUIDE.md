## ⚠️ iOS Limitations

### Why No Push Notifications on iPhone?

**Apple's Policy:**
- Apple doesn't support Web Push API on iOS Safari (yet)
- Only native iOS apps from App Store can send push notifications
- This is an Apple limitation, not our app limitation
- Many developers are asking Apple to add this feature

**Expected Timeline:**
- Apple announced Web Push support coming to iOS 16.4+ (March 2023)
- Limited implementation so far
- Full support expected in future iOS updates

**Current Workarounds:**
1. **Use Android/Desktop for Admin:**
   - Keep Android phone or laptop for admin notifications
   - iPhone for everything else

2. **Check Dashboard Regularly:**
   - Open admin app on iPhone periodically
   - Check for new bookings, messages manually

3. **Email Notifications:**
   - You still get email notifications
   - Check email on iPhone
