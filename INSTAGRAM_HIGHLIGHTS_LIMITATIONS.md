# Instagram Highlights - Manual Upload Alternative

## Why Highlights Aren't Syncing

Instagram's Graph API has **very limited access** to Stories and Highlights:

### API Limitations:
1. **Stories API is deprecated** - No longer available for most apps
2. **Highlights require Business Discovery API** - Only works for other accounts you own
3. **Stories expire after 24 hours** - Can't fetch old stories
4. **Requires special permissions** - instagram_basic + instagram_manage_insights
5. **Facebook Page connection required** - Must link Instagram to Facebook Page

### Reality Check:
Instagram severely restricted Stories/Highlights API access due to privacy concerns. Most apps can only access:
- ✅ Feed posts (images/videos)
- ✅ Reels
- ❌ Stories (24-hour content)
- ❌ Highlights (archived stories)

## 💡 Alternative Solution: Manual Highlights

Since the API doesn't work reliably, I recommend creating a **manual highlights system**:

### Option 1: Upload Highlights Manually
Create an admin interface to:
1. Create highlight categories (About, Portfolio, Services, etc.)
2. Upload images/videos for each highlight
3. Set cover images
4. Order and manage stories

### Option 2: Use Albums as Highlights
Repurpose the existing Albums system:
1. Create albums with names like your highlights
2. Add photos to each album
3. Display them in the Stories circle format
4. Click to view like Stories

### Option 3: Embed Instagram Widget
Use Instagram's official embed:
1. Add Instagram feed widget
2. Link to your Instagram profile
3. Let users view highlights on Instagram directly

## 🎯 Best Solution: Manual Highlights Manager

Let me create a custom highlights management system where you can:

1. **Create Highlights** 
   - Name (e.g., "About", "Portfolio", "Contact")
   - Cover image
   - Order

2. **Add Stories**
   - Upload images/videos
   - Add captions
   - Set display order
   - Link to external URLs

3. **Display on Homepage**
   - Instagram-style circles
   - Swipeable stories viewer
   - Beautiful animations

Would you like me to build this manual highlights manager? It will give you:
- ✅ Full control over content
- ✅ No API limitations
- ✅ Better quality (upload full resolution)
- ✅ More flexibility (custom content)
- ✅ No dependency on Instagram

## 📝 Summary

**Instagram Highlights API doesn't work for most accounts.**

Instead, you have 3 options:
1. Manual highlights system (recommended)
2. Use albums as highlights
3. Link to Instagram profile
