                     CRITICAL: HOSTING REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Your Platform Requires:
-----------------------
✓ Node.js 18+ runtime (server-side JavaScript)
✓ Persistent server process (always running)
✓ API routes (backend endpoints)
✓ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
✓ MongoDB connectivity (already configured)
✓ Cloudinary access (already configured)

Traditional Hosting (PHP/HTML) is NOT ENOUGH!
----------------------------------------------
Your Next.js app is NOT a simple website. It needs:
- Continuous Node.js process running
- Server that supports Next.js framework
- Ability to handle API requests
- Real-time features support

================================================================================
                   OXAHOST PLUS PLAN - COMPATIBILITY CHECK
================================================================================

CRITICAL QUESTION: Does Your Oxahost Plus Plan Support Node.js?
----------------------------------------------------------------

How to Check:
1. Log into Oxahost cPanel
2. Search for "Setup Node.js App" or "Node.js Selector"
3. Look for "Application Manager" in menu
4. Check if SSH/Terminal access is available

IF FOUND → You can deploy to Oxahost (follow Option A)
IF NOT FOUND → Use Railway or Vercel (follow Option B or C)

================================================================================
                    DO YOU NEED OXAHOST? (REALITY CHECK)
================================================================================

Traditional Hosting (Oxahost) is Designed For:
-----------------------------------------------
✗ WordPress blogs
✗ PHP websites (Laravel, CodeIgniter)
✗ HTML/CSS static sites
✗ Simple contact forms
✗ Traditional CMS platforms

Your Platform Technology:
-------------------------
✓ Full-stack JavaScript application (Next.js)
✓ Real-time features
✓ Complex database operations
✓ Advanced image processing
✓ Server-side rendering
✓ API endpoints
✓ Modern web technology

Better Hosting Platforms for Your Needs:
-----------------------------------------
1. Railway (RECOMMENDED) - Built for Node.js
2. Vercel - Made by Next.js creators
3. Render - Modern deployment platform
4. DigitalOcean App Platform - Professional
5. AWS Amplify - Enterprise-grade

Oxahost MIGHT Work IF:
- They have Node.js support in cPanel
- You can run persistent processes
- SSH access is available
- Resource limits are adequate

But Railway/Vercel are BETTER because:
- Designed specifically for Node.js apps
- Easier deployment process
- Better performance optimization
- Automatic scaling
- Professional developer experience
- Free tiers available

================================================================================
                         COST SAVINGS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Current Situation:
------------------
Oxahost Plus Plan: $X/month (your current cost)

Option 1: Keep Oxahost (If Node.js Supported)
- Cost: Current Oxahost cost
- Savings: $0

Option 2: Switch to Railway
- Railway: $0-5/month (free tier likely enough)
- Cancel Oxahost: Save your current cost
- Net Savings: (Oxahost cost - $5) per month

Option 3: Use Vercel
- Vercel: $0/month (free tier)
- Cancel Oxahost: Save your current cost
- Net Savings: Full Oxahost cost per month

Example Calculation:
--------------------
If Oxahost Plus = $15/month
Switch to Railway Free = $0/month
Annual Savings = $180/year

If Oxahost Plus = $30/month
Switch to Railway = $5/month
Annual Savings = $300/year

Recommendation:
---------------
Unless Oxahost has excellent Node.js support and you're already
paying for it, switching to Railway or Vercel will likely:
- Save you money
- Give you better performance
- Provide easier deployment
- Offer better scalability
