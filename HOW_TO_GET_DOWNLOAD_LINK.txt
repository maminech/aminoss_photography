# 📱 GET YOUR DOWNLOAD LINK - FOLLOW THESE STEPS

## 🎯 Quick Answer:

**I cannot give you a download link yet because the APK needs to be built first.**

The mobile app is currently **source code**. It needs to be compiled into an APK file that Android devices can install.

## 🚀 EVEN EASIER - Use My Script

I created a script that does everything:

```powershell
cd "e:\aminoss photography"
.\build-mobile-app.ps1
```

This will:
1. ✅ Check if EAS CLI is installed (installs if needed)
2. ✅ Check if you're logged in (prompts if needed)
3. ✅ Build the APK
4. ✅ Show you the download link

## 📥 What to Do With the Link

### Option 1: Share Directly
- Copy the Expo link
- Share with admins via WhatsApp/Email
- Link works for 30 days

### Option 2: Host on Your Server
```powershell
# Download APK from Expo link
# Then:
mkdir "e:\aminoss photography\public\downloads"
# Place APK as: aminoss-admin.apk
cd "e:\aminoss photography"
vercel --prod
# Link: https://your-domain.com/downloads/aminoss-admin.apk
```

### Option 3: Google Drive
- Download APK
- Upload to Google Drive
- Share → Get link → Anyone with link
- Copy and share

## 🎯 Why I Can't Give You Link Now

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Mobile app **code** is complete
- ✅ Download **page** is ready
- ✅ Download **button** is in admin dashboard
- ❌ APK **file** not built yet

**Think of it like:**
- Code = Recipe 📝
- Build = Cooking 👨‍🍳
- APK = Finished meal 🍕

Right now we have the recipe, but need to cook it first!
